# Certificate App

## [Workflows](./Workflow.md)

## Working

Each certificate is combination of attributes including template, timestamp, status, owner, issuer and other user defined attributes.
A certificate template is populated with attributes and rendered in realtime on client side, rather than generating image for each certificate.
